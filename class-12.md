## Chart.JS

Utilizing the Chart.js libray, we can make graphs and other charts that are more visually satisfying to those looking at data. The Chart object has Bar, Line, and Pie methods to generate charts based on your needs. You can easily create the chart by passing in an object argument that contains at least data in the case of a pie chart, and labels for the line and bar charts.
