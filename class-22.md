## How I Explained REST To My Brother

1. Roy Fielding was one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification.
2. The techniques we use today were used to talk to a small group of machines rather than all of the machines.
3. The HTTP protocol Fielding and his friends created is a way of interacting with another system, such as GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
4. - GET: Request information that already exists
   - POST: Send new information to be added
   - PUT: Update information that already exists
   - PATCH: Partial update of information that already exists
