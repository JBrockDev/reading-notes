# Class 16 - Reading Notes

## Intro to React and Components

Component Based Architecture
1. A component is an encapsulated set of code designed for reuse.
2. Reusability, replaceable, non-context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent are the characteristics of a component.
3. Benefits of using components are reusability, reduced cost, reliability, etc. Let's say a date component is displayed on one view with a list of events, but then you also wanted the date on the view with the breakdown of an individual event -- you could use a date component in both spots to place the exact same styled element or group of elements there.

What is Props and How to Use it in React
1. Props is a keyword in react similar to args in C# and Java. It allows the passing of data from one component to another.
2. Props are used to pass data from the parent element to the child element.
3. The flow is uni-directional - from parent to child.
