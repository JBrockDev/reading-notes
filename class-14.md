## What Google Learned About Teams

After extensive research of tons and tons of data, a team put together to figure out what makes a successful team was unable to find any patterns initially. Eventually, they narrowed it down to certain norms that are typically shared between successful teams.

The first norm that successful teams normally had in common was all members generally spoke in equal proportions of time to one another. Basically, everyone contributed to the conversation as opposed to one person or a smaller collection of the group speaking.

The second norm was people on the teams all had a good ability to sense how others are feeling through non-verbal cues and expressions. Having the ability to know when someone feels left out or is unhappy enables addressing it so that the issue may be fixed and they can contribute at their full potential again.

An important note, which was derrived from a Harvard Business School professor, Amy Edmonson, is that it's psychological safety such that, "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarass, reject or punish someone for speaking up. It describes a team climated characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves."

Through an exchange with a google manager Matt Sakaguchi, who recently lead a team that didn't go so well, the research team gave him surveys to give to his new team. A few weeks after working together, Sakaguchi received the results and was shocked by the fact that what he though was a strong team actually had weaknesses. Members were unsure of the impact their work provided to the big picture. This lead to team members feeling unfulfilled with the work they put into the team. Matt invited the team to gather off-site to discuss the results in a non-work enviornment. He shared that he has cancer and it's progressively getting worse. Other team members opened up about their issues following his lead. This lead to them all forming personal bonds with one another that was previously missing even though they liked one another. Towards the end of their off-site gathering, he agreed to work harder at helping them see the impact they're causing in the big picture and they agreed to try to be more attentative to if someone's feeling excluded or down. 

The Google research team has come to the conclusion that people don't want to fully seperate themselves from who they are at work. They want to be able to be their entire self at work, whereas most positions require shedding part of your personality to 'fit' the role or be more 'effective.' By being themselves, people can collaborate better and feel more able to do so without fear of rejection/judgement.
