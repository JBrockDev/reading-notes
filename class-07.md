## Tables (HTML)

 Tables are an option of grid-format display for data just the same as anywhere else you might run into tables handling data. The construction of a table will start with the `<table>` tag, followed by a `<tr>` tag which indicates a new row. Even the top row where the headers go is a row. For the first row, you will want header tags `<th>` where you specify the data that will be in each column downward. For each successive row, you will use the `<td>` tag which means table data, ie data for that particular cell. Additionally, you can use the `row-span` attribute to indicate how many rows downward you want a cell to fill in the event you want it to take up two cells in a column or `col-span` attribute for doing the same but combining columns left to right.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects (JS)

 When creating objects in javascript, sometimes you want many of a certain object, but with it's own values. For instance, we could build a car factory representation in Javascript where we first build the blueprint of the car, then we use that blueprint to make the actual car product for sale. So, we would make the blueprint by creating general things like number of windows, number of wheels, has a steering wheel, has gas and break pedals, etc. Then we also need to give it methods like drive, car alarm, break, unlock door, turn on ignition. Now once we have the blueprint for all of these, we can then make individual cars with this blueprint, however, there are some attributes that will vary between individual cars like color - some might be black, some might be blue, some might be red. Attributes that change would pretty much be the options that are offered by a dealership to add to the car from it's base status. In Javascript, once we've had that base model done, we can just make a 'new' copy of it and change the option values to fit the needs of the particular unit. This inherits all the things the base model has and then modifies it to the particular need.
