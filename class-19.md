# Class 19 - Reading Notes

## Forms

1. A controlled component is a component where React takes over the state of the component. Ie: the state for an input field is controlled by react rather than default html behavior.
2. The state for a controlled component gets updated as they fill out the form, otherwise it's not a controlled component.
3. event.target.value is how you target an input box when utilizing an event handler.
 
1. ## Ternary Operator
2. 1. Ternary operators can make code shorter and more readable, conversely it can also make it a lot less readable. Discretion needs to be used.
3. 2. x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false); (way to write if (x===y) { return true; } else { return false;}
