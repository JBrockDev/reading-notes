# Class 5 - Reading Notes

## Images (HTML)

There's multiple reasons for using images, for example almost every website has a logo and most have some sort of graphics. Additionally, some websites use a background image, which can be done via css styling. CSS will allow you to alter the way the image is viewed different from it's supplied format. There's several tools that enable you to edit images to better suit them for the website as well which will always be more oprtimal than using html. Further, different file types are typically used for different types of images so it's advised to choose the best file type for the use when possible. A uniqure type of image is a vector image, when vector images have their resolutions change - the image will proportionally change more exact than a non-vector image. 

## Color (HTML)

Most things on your page can have colors set to them. You can use three different types of color values to choose the color you want. RGB, HEX, and color names are those types. There are 247 pre-set color names for ease of use. Two important color designations are foreground and background. An important thing to learn is contrast between these two colors. Too low of contrast can be an issue with seeing and too high of contrast can be daunting on the eyes for longer periods of time. CSS3 created a new way to alter colors by introducing hue, saturation and lightness values. 

## Text (HTML)

Typefaces while different can often be categorized in different groups such as Serif, Sans-Serif, Monospace, Cursive, and Fantasy. Additionally, they have attributes like weight, style, stretch. CSS allows the use of scaling, which can even be used to set elements to scale from their parents making it so if you ever want to change the size of text for a page - you can edit one value and the rest change proportionally. Different units of size are pixels, percentage and em.
