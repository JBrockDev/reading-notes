2. JavaScript is only able to one call at a time.
3. LIFO means last in, first out.
4. ![Stack Drawing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885714386889613365/890772906618011668/unknown.png)
5. A stack overflow occurs when a function recursively calls itself without an exit condition or being able to hit the exit condition.

## JavaScript Error Messages

1. A reference error is when you try to use a variable that has yet to have it's value declared.
2. A syntax error, as the name indicates, is an error in the syntax.
3. Using using a length that is not between 0 and the length of the array.
4. A type error is often occuring when trying to use the property of an object, but that variable is actually undefined.
5. A breakpoint is a point you can set in your code to stop running code once it reaches that point so that you can go step by step to find the issue and/or see the values of variables at certain points.
6. Debugger is an alternate way to create a breakpoint in your code.
