## CSS Transformations/Animations/ETC


CSS animations can definitely bring a page to life if done well and with restraint. Too many animations can detract, but a few can help to keep the user interested. As someone who's less of a geometry thinker, there's a bit of weirdness to the ways of doing things, but thankfully there's many resources where people have already done a lot of transformations. There's tons of snippets of css to place and play around with, then make edits if you need. Transitions seem a bit more logical and easier to recreate, but animations are more like the transformations.
