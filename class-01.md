# Class 1 - Reading Notes

## Structure (HTML)

Webpages are no different than any media in that they need to have structure in mind when creating. Placing things in random places is going to create a lack of interest in whatever you're putting on your page. To create this structure, we have a couple tools. 
- Tags - A type of markup that is like a container for the text, images or other data between the open and closing tag. Although some markups the open and close are within the same tag as they don't contain anything and are for formatting.
- Attributes - These are ways to provide additional information about a tag they are included in. Attributes need a name and a value. The name indicates what is being changed and the value indicates what it is being changed to.

## Extra Markup (HTML)

- Doctype - this indicates which version of html is being used so the browser can display the markup correctly
- Comments - this is for denoting text which is not to be displayed, it is commonly used to seperate chunks of markup that go together or describe what the markup is doing
- Class Attribute - this is for uniquely identifying multiple elements typically for css styling purposes
- ID Attribute - this is like a class attribute, but more specific, it relates to a single element
- Block Element - elements that appear on a new line are called block elements
- Inline Element - Inline elements flow from the last element on the page

## HTML5 Layout (HTML)
- Header - Typically used at the beginning of the body
- Footer - Typically used at the bottom of the body, commonly includes copyrite information and other details
- Section - Typically used to group elements of similar contents together

## Process & Design

When designing a website, you first want to think about the target audience. If you're targeting kids, you may want to use a more colorful design with less rigid structure. If you're targeting developers with code related information or documentation, you'll probably want plain colors with a more rigid structure. You can create a disagram called a site map, which will show the user flow from page to page. Showing which pages link to which other pages or subpages to get information related. Wireframing is also helpful in that you can create a quick mockup of how it will visually look and adjust things prior to putting in the time to code and then realizing you or your test audience think it should look entirely different. Navigation of your website is best kept straight and to the point. 

## The ABC of Programming

Website code is going to be contained within a script, whether it's a script tag or a seperate script file. Through code, we replicate the real world. For example, we may need to create something called a car. This car, we would need to specify the number of doors, the number of tires, windows, etc. This would be creating the car object and asigning the door, tire, window, etc attributes to the car object, then asigning a value to the attribute for that specific car. Further, we can use events for the car, such as a real car being broken into would cause a car alarm to go off, so we could replicate that with a car alarm event. Cars do various things, the most simple would be to drive. We replicate this with methods. Drive would be an action the car does in terms of code.
